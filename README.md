# Numerical-Method
Series of codes for numerical computations.
===========================================
This was created as a storage for codes I made and will make for Numerical Computation and Chemical Engineering Modeling.
Languages used in these codes are C++ and Python, as they're a lot more preffered than Fortran nor Pascal.

If anyone who's analysing my code find something wrong or something that just could be done more efficiently,
please contact me at: randomcursedemail@gmail.com.

Thanks for reading.
