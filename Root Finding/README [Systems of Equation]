From runs I've had done, here's a list of stuffs I've encountered so far:
1. The program is working fine up to 4 equations.
2. Over 4 sets of equations, problems start occuring:
  2.1. Sometimes the program would just not run and the result would just be "NaN". After some troubleshottings,
       I've known that "NaN" comes out when inversing the jacobian matrix.
       - Sometimes this problem can be fixed just by rearranging the equations, but sometimes not.
  2.2. If the program could run over 4 sets of equations, the solution for the last variable will always be wrong.
       For example in 8 sets of equation, the solution for x1 up to x7 would all be correct, but not for x8.
       - This can be fixed by minimalising amount of equation if possible by substituting easy to solve or obvious
         variables with number or other variables with same value (all of these are known from the equation sets).
       - If it's not possible to minimise the system to at max 4 equations, do couple more runs with known and
         assumed correct solutions replacing variables (remember, the last solution at 4+ will always be wrong).

Thank you for reading,
if anyone has a solution for fixing this problem feel free to contact me at: randomcursedemail@gmail.com.
Update will come if the solution has been found.
